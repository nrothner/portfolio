												<h2> About me</h2>
												<p>Professional Interests</p>
											</header>
											<div>
												<p>Hi, thanks for coming to my website! I am currently a self-taught front-end web developer but took the long way to figure out my true passion. During my undergraduate degree, like many other bright-eyed freshmen, I wanted to pursue a career in health care – specifically plastic surgery. After my first semester I switched to pre-veterinary medicine. Another semester later and I was a psychology major. There was quite a bit of switching back and forth, but it wasn’t until my senior year I took “Human Computer Interaction” and “Introduction to Computer Science” that I realized what I wanted to do. I became teaching assistant for my HCI course in my final semester of college.</p>
												<p>The summer after graduation, I spent all my free time teaching myself to code. I worked hard to understand JavaScript and decided a coding bootcamp was the right course for me. At the same time, I got offered a position at MITRE that I could not turn down, so I put my dreams to become a develop on hold in hopes to moving up from the inside. I was extremely dedicated and after 2 years or hard work and networking, my current manager took a chance on me and offered me a position within her team. I have been with my current team for a year and a half while simultaneously pursuing my master’s in human Factors and Applied Cognition and could not be more grateful for these opportunities. <p>

												<p>Future Plans</p>
											</header>
											<div>
												<p>In the future, I plan to use my knowledge from my graduate degree to apply to my current and future projects. I am currently hosting training sessions on UX at MITRE to help employees understand how to build websites with the user in mind.</p>
												<p>I plan to continue coding and my next step is a certificate in Web Development. I love working with CSS and hope to work more with animations in the future. In addition, I’ve recently started working with JSON, Flows, and PowerApps, to manipulate SharePoint Online lists. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with that as well.</p>
												<p>In all my websites I incorporate user testing when possible, and if not, I use expert methods such as heuristic evaluations. I plan to continue this with the knowledge I obtain from my degree.</p>

												<p>Personal Interests</p>
											</header>
											<div>
												<p>I grew up on the island of Saint Maarten which made for an extremely interesting childhood and unconventional way of life. Because of this, I have a strong appreciation for different cultures and languages and caught the travel bug a young age. I love to travel and try to go to a new place every year. My most recent vacation was in 2019 when I went to Barcelona and Greece. Once COVID is over, I plan to go to either Africa or Thailand.</p>
												<p>My favorite activity is rock climbing. I began in the summer of 2018 and have been going strong. I have yet to climb outdoors but it is on my bucket list to hopefully cross off soon.</p>
