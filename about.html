												<h2> About me</h2>
												<p>Professional Interests</p>
											</header>
											<div>
												<p>Hi, thanks for coming to my website! I am currently a self-taught front-end web developer but took the long way to figure out my true passion. During my undergraduate degree, like many other bright-eyed freshmen, I wanted to pursue a career in health care – specifically plastic surgery, but it wasn’t until my senior year I took “Human Computer Interaction” and “Introduction to Computer Science” that I realized what I really wanted to do. I became teaching assistant for my HCI course in my final semester of college and started my path to becoming a Web Developer.</p>
												<p>The summer after graduation, I spent all my free time teaching myself to code. I worked hard to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was offered a position at MITRE as an Analyst and after 2 years of hard work and networking, my current manager offered me a position within her team. I have been with my team for about a year and a half while simultaneously pursuing my Master’s degree in Human Factors and Applied Cognition. I am grateful for these opportunities and will graduate from my program in the Spring. <p>
												<p>I have been working closely with the WordPress SME to conduct regular information sessions to employees about how to use WordPress and best practices for UX through the MITRE Institute and bi-weekly Lunch and Learn sessions open to all employees. I enjoy development but also think it's important to provide others with the tools to maintain their own websites once we get it up and running. By allowing non-developers to maintain their websites, it provides me with the freedom to work on more complex problems and gives them the opportunity and confidence to update their content on a regular basis.</p>

												<p>Future Plans</p>
											</header>
											<div>
												<p>In the future, I plan to use my knowledge from my graduate degree to apply to my current and future projects. I want to expand on my training sessions on UX at MITRE to help employees understand how to build websites with the user in mind and encourage consideration of UX throughout the entire process.</p>
												<p>My next step is a certificate in Web Development. I love working with CSS and hope to work more with animations in the future. In addition, I’ve recently started working with JSON, Flows, and PowerApps, to manipulate SharePoint Online lists. I am also very interested in expanding my knowledge and skillset in Drupal as it is becoming more prevalent at MITRE and can be a powerful CMS.</p>
												<p>In all my websites I incorporate user testing when possible, and if not, I use expert methods such as heuristic evaluations. I plan to continue this with the knowledge I obtain from my degree and make sure my customers understand the importance of user testing and what that means to their websites.</p>

												<p>Personal Interests</p>
											</header>
											<div>
												<p>I grew up on the island of Saint Maarten which made for an extremely interesting childhood and unconventional way of life. Because of this, I have a strong appreciation for different cultures and languages and began to travel at a young age. I love to travel and try to go to a new place every year. My most recent vacation was in 2019 when I went to Barcelona and Greece. Once COVID is over, I plan to go to either Africa or Thailand.</p>
												<p>My favorite activity is rock climbing and I try to go at least three times a week.</p>
